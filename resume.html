                  - Took part in the planning and execution of the "Buy Now"
                  business request. Integrated Redis and RocketMQ based on the
                  MySQL master-slave architecture to enhance throughput,
                  elevating it from the thousands to the tens of thousands QPS
                  range. <br />
                  - Decomposed the existing monolithic order system into
                  specialized promotion and order microservices in alignment
                  with Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and SOLID principles,
                  enhancing maintainability and scalability. Utilized Consul as
                  the service registry, orchestrated API routing through Spring
                  Cloud Gateway, leveraged OpenFeign for declarative API calls.
                  <br />
                  - Utilized JOOQ as the database Object-Relational Mapping
                  (ORM) tool and used Flyway for database version control and
                  migration, ensuring seamless schema updates and application
                  consistency. - Bolstered system performance with cache
                  preheating for active promotions, significantly reducing
                  response times. Employed Redis and Lua scripting to ensure TCC
                  (Try-Confirm-Cancel) compliance for inventory locking and
                  reversion.<br />
                  - Peak-load shifting order service stress by asynchronously
                  creating order using RocketMQ. Implemented "Pay-Check&Cancel"
                  by consuming delay messages. And optimized optimistic-lock of
                  updating inventory in MySQL database.<br />
                  - Integrated Hystrix into inventory service to boost system
                  resilience, minimizing fault rates and safeguarding against
                  cascading failures.
